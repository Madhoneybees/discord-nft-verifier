## üõ°Ô∏è Security

This bot uses a secure signature verification method that never requires users to share private keys or approve transactions. The verification process:

1. Generates a unique challenge for the user
2. User signs the challenge with their wallet
3. Bot verifies the signature cryptographically
4. Bot checks NFT ownership via blockchain queries

All sensitive information is stored in environment variables, not in the code.
